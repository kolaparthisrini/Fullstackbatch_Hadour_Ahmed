Basics of Java:
-----------------
Java is a programming language.
Any hardware is controlled through s/w.

>>>>>>>>Thses s/w are designed using C,C++,.net or java.
>Java is more popular because of platform independency.
Java comes with 3 editions.
1)JSE/J2SE: JSE stands for Java Standard Edition.JSE is used for creating desktop apps like ms-office,notepad....
2)JEE/J2EE: JEE stands for JAva enterprise edition.JEE is used for creating Enterprise apps like banking,insurance...
3)JME/J2ME:Java Mobile edition.USed for designing mobile apps or can be used for Embedded Systems.
Embedded systems is a combination of hardware and s/w.
>>JME is a failure for designing mobile apps.

Latest version of java is 1.19.Industry is using still 1.8.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Features of JAva:
1)Java is secure
2)robust
3)Platform independent....etc


If s/w is designed using "C/C+:,then that code will not work in All o/s.

If a Programming language supports pointers,then that programming language will not run in all o/s.
>>In programming languages,every variable will have an address.That address we are calling it as Pointers.
Java doesnt support pointers.Thats why it is platform independent.
Java code be executed in any type of operating system,because it is platform independent.

>>>C:\Program Files\Java

TO design any program using java,we need to follow the below way.

Write the code-------->Save the code(save the file with .java)------>Compile the code using java Compiler------>Run the code(.class)

To compile or to run a java code,we need to have JDK  and JVM.In eclipse,Auto compilation feature is enabled by default.
If we use IDE,no need to compile.


Projectname/classname firstletter shouldbe Upper Case.
We should not use Spaces in file or projectname.
Always Substring should start with upper case.
Example:
Helloworld---not accepted
HelloWorld----Accepted
Dont use unnecessarily special symbols like &~@$%^*().
Always code shld be created in a package.We should avoid default packages.
Package should follow below syntax:
Example: com.projectname.modulename

Package names shld not be in upper case.
>>We can create as many packages as we can.There is no limit on no of packages.

Example:

Assume you are working on 4 requirements.
4 difrrent packages shld be created.

Assume projectname is Maheshbank.
com.maheshbank.fundtrasfer
com.maheshbank.payments
Note: Default is not allowed in projects.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

Library : library is a type of package with predefined methods,classes with logic.
libraries are of 2 types.
1)predefined :oracle is giving to us by default.
2)Userdefined--means developer will create.

Steps for running code:
1)Write the code in a file and save the file using .java.
2)Compile the code using javac command.
3)After compiling,we will get .class file which is bytecode.
4)After that run the .class file using java command.

Bytecode: bytecode is a combination of o,1 and special symbols.

Note: Always public classname and filename should be same.

JVM stands for java virtual machine.JVM is used for running the code.

Command to compile: javac filename.java
Running: java filename


Points: installed Eclipse,set the jdk path,testing java program,features of java,compiling the code,running the code on IDE and command prompt,bytecode,package creation,naming rules for project creation,type s of java editions.

Variables and datatypes
loops 
String API
condtional staments
command line arguments---important while deployments

OOPS,collections,multithreading basics
Variables and datatypes:
========================
>variable:
============
a variable is a container/storage for storing your data temporarly.
>Evry variable will have a datatype.
>a variable cannot exist without datatype.
>variable shld be named properly and it should be meaningfull.

Syntax for declaring a variable:

Datatype variablename;

Syntax for defining or storing value in a variable:

Datatype <variablename> = <value>

Example: int a = 90;

Datatype specifies the type of data that we want to store in a variable.

bit means either 1 or 0
1 byte = 8 bits
bytes= no of bits/8

Primitive datatypes:
---------------------------
boolean-------1 bit---default value is false
char----------2 bytes---default value is \u0000
byte-------1 byte---default value is 0
short---2 bytes---default value is 0
int-----4 bytes---default value is 0
long------8 bytes---default value is 0L
float----4 bytes---default value is 0.0f
double-------8 bytes---default value is 0.0


boolean a = true;
System.out.println(a);


Non primitive datatypes:
-----------------------
class,interfaces,String and arrays


>System.out.println()
System is predefined class.
out is a static reference
println is a predefined method.

out means output ie monitor
in means input ie keyboard
error means error
33
i want to give a value and b vaule at runtime?

>>Scanner class is mainly for inserting values at runtime.

Once scanner is opened,we need to close it.

Note: As per best practices,we need to close the scanner object.

In java,if we want to make a variable a constant,then we need to use the keyword "final".

final int con;//declared
con = 90;//defined
		
final int con = 90;//delcared and defined

--------------------------------
String API

String is a group of characters.
>Strings are represented using "".
>>Character are represented using ''.

I/p: apple
o/p: APPLE

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

String had given us so many predefined methods to deal with conversions.

1)
String t = "Skolaparthi";
i/p: a
o/p: available

i/p: z
o/p: Not available

================================================================
Loops and conditional Statements:
---------------------------------
>
Conditional Statements:
---------------------------
when even we want to perform conditional checkings.
1)if
if condition will check for true or false.
2)if-else
3)switch

i need to check whether the given value is > 100 or not.
Note: At a time only one block will be executed in if-else.

if()
{
if()
{
}
}


Switch is mainly for checking/testing multiple conditions.
Switch is replacement for nested-ifs.
Syntax:

switch(expression)
{
case value:
//statements
break;

case value:
//statements
break;

case value:
//statements
break;

default:
//statements
}

using switch:

i/p is Apple
o/p:Apple is matched

Switch Rules:
=============
>switch accepts integeres,strings and enums from >1.7.0 version onwards.
enums are like classes but it is used for creating multiple constants.
>any no of switch cases can be written.
>only one default is allowed.
>break statement is optional in switch,but removing break might cause your logic change.
>Every case shld have only 1 break.
>break shld be last statement in case.
>No break is allowed in default.
>break is not recommended in default case.It will never throw any error message.

Note: switch within switch is accepted.

Loops:
======
Loops are used for repeating as task until condition fails.
1)for---to
2)while

in while first condition is checked and then body is executed.
Syntax:

while(condition)
{

increment/decrement values;
}
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


3)do-while

reverse of while is do while.
start;
do
{
} while(condition);

first body is executed and then condition is checked.

display 2 5 8 11


I want to display 2 table.

2*1=2
2*2=4
2*3=6
2*10=20

+ operator is used for string concatenation.
4)for-each
========================================================================================

Observations form your exercises:
--------------------------------
Positives: 
code is clear
you had written comments for few exercises.

Negitive:
for few example no comments.

Over All: Very good

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
For Loop:
===========
initialization
While(condition)
{

increment/decrement;
}


for loop syntax:
for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
{
//statements
}
diffrence is mainly syntax.
Using for loop i want to display 1.....100

>>i dont want to display 7 from following series.
12345678910
o/p:1234568910

I need to display  below series;

1*2*3*4*5* using for loop


Z Y X ........A

Evry alphabet will have asci code.

Type casting: converting from one datatype to another is called as type cast.
(char)a

Syntax:
(target datatype)current datatype

>1 2 3 4 5 End of the Loop

Break: break is for breaking/coming out of the loop.
Continue: this is for ignoring the loop based on condition.Continue will not break loop.
Note: break and continue cannot be used at same time.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Array:
======

int a = 90;//means ata time we can store only one value.
what if we want to store more value?
sol)Arrays and collections.
Arrays are mainly used for storing similar type of data.

1 2 3 4 5 6  8 ===>Arrays
1 q 345 ggg=====>collections

Syntax: datatype[] arr or datatype arr[]

arrays will have index
Always index starts with 0.

index cannot be negitive.But in python,index can be negitive.

For-each loop:
=============
>is similar like for loop.But it is more advanced and simplied version of for loop.
>used frquently in bigdata projects and data engineering projects.
>syntax:

for(datatype var: array)
{

//statements
}

for-each is mainly used for arrays and collections.
>>>>>>

Assume there is an character array with 7 chracters.I want to copy the array data to another array.
Write a program for the above requirement.

To copy an array from one to another array,use predefined method "arraycopy".
System.arraycopy(source array,index position of source array,destination array,destination index position,no of elements to be copied);
>>Some times ,we need tpo clone an array.
clone means a copy of an array.

---------------------------
Methods and command line arguments.

command line arguments: this feature is used for passing some values to main method.
	public static void main(String[] args)-----main is method,the parameters are called as "command line arguments"
	
	parameters or arguments both are same.
	
	arguments is alias name for parameter.
	
>I want to pass values from one function to another function.
void means no return.

Functions:
===========
>function is a group os statements.
Every function will have a return type.if not void.
>Every function will have { }.
>Functions are of  2 types.
1)userdefined
2)predefined. Example: arraycopy,println

method vs function?functions will return values.
methods wont return any value.

Task1:
Write a java program using functions.2 table display and reverse string.

Exception Handling:
====================
Any operation on null leads to NullpointerException.
>if any exception arises,then program execution will stop automatically.
>if developer things,that code might throw exception or error message,then he need to surronder the code with try and catch blocks.

SYNTAX:
	try
	{
	}
	catch(Exception class)
	{
	}


>Finally block is mandetory while dealing with databases,io,networking...etc.
>per try block,we ca have only 1 finally.

try shld be followed with catch or finally.
>1 try block can have multiple catch blocks.
>per try only 1 finally is allowed.
>in between try and finally or catch,we shld not write any logic.
>try and catch can be there even in finally.
> we can also write try and catch even in catch block.
>try with in try is also accepted.
>dont use try and catch in loops unnecessarily.
>>In object oriented programming languages,Object is the base class.
Every class will have parent.

Example:

my fathers father
!
Father--base means parent
!
Srinivas

>>Unnecessarily dont use "Exception base class".If suitations demand then only use Base Exception class.
Exceptions which are thrown by JVM at compile time is called as checked/compile time exceptions.
Exceptions which are thrown by JVM at run time is called as un-checked/run time exceptions.
Errors as Well.errors are related to hardware issues like memory issue,heap issues...etc
/
******************Imp**************
1) try without catch,is it possible?
ans)yes.but finally shld be there.

try{
}
finally{
}

2) catch  without try,is it possible?
ans) No

3)can i have multiple catchs?
ans)yes

4)can i have multiple finally for try block?
ans)no

5)can i use break in try block?
ans) yes,but with loop.
break shld be used in combination with loops and switch.

6)can i use break in between try  and catch block?
ans)no

7)
finally{
}
catch()
{
}
try
{

ans) not accepted

8)try and catch in finally block?
ans)yes

Assertions are mainly used for testing the results.

a=9,b=9;
add(int a,int b)
{
return a-b;
}

Assertions will check expected result with achived results.
Expected:18
Achived:0
if not matching,it will be RED.
if matching it will be GREEN.
if a persons age is >=18,then he is eligible to right to vote.

sudo apt install mysql-server

To see msg.

1)Assertions shld be combined with Junit.
2)Enable assertion feature in VM.by default assertions are disabled in java.
java -ea
ea---enable assertions
disable assertions: java -da
--------------------------------------------------
OOPS concepst in Java
Typecastings
==========================
>OOPS stands for object orineted Programming Synopsis.
C is a Structured Programming language.We are going to write logic in functions.
C++ is object based Programming Language..
Java,C#,eiffel,smalltalk these are pure object oriented==>We are going to write logic in functions which are part of 
classes.
>Any programming language which supports below feature can be called as Object oritend Programming language.

On which basis can we say a programming language is Ooriented?
ans) your language shld support:Classes,Objects,Inheritance,Abstraction,Polymorphism and Message passing.

Any thing which is physically visible is called as Object.
Every object will have SBI.
S---buttons
B---Evry button will have functionality.
I--->Identity.means name.K9 Pro-Max Android 9.0 Projector


SBI for switch.

Identity is switch
behaviour---fan rotating
state--on or off

Class:A class is a combination of behaviours and states.


In java to create a class,we will use the keyword "class".


in cars we have sports cars,luxory cars and normal cars.


All above are beloinging to the class Cars.
Syntax:

<access specifier> class <classname>{

//statements

}

capgemini---we write classes below main method.

>memory is not allocated to class by default.Once if we create an object then only memory will be allocated.
-A class is useless with out object.
-An object cannot exist with out class.
-A class can exist wihtout object.
-we can have as many clases as we can.No limit.But only one public class is allowed.
Example


To create an object,below is the syntax:

<classname> refrencevariable = new <classname>();
new will allocate memory in heap.

Always make sure predefined names can be used as a varaible.


Can i name my self as rocket?


Always objects will be saved in Heap memory.

>>Always variables in a class shld be private.
methods shld be public.

public means from anywhere from your code you can access.
private means you can access only from your class.
>>Every object will have address.
>Create a java program for additon and even numbers using OOPS concepts.
>meemory for an class allocated only through object.

if we want to see memory allocation and cpu utilization,we can see using JvisualVM tool.This tool is available under bin folder of your jdk.
There might be some isssues in MAC while viewing the Jvisual VM.

Alternatives: New relic,Appdynamics,Datadog,sentry.....etc

USing Appdynamics,we can monitor,servers,java app,databases and cloud.
----------------------------
Class and object-----completed
Constructors:A constrcutor is a function whose name is same as class name.
Constructors wont return any value.
>this is used mainly for initializing class variable.
Overloading----function and constructor overloading
Inheritance
Polymorphsim
un-named blocks---completed

Any variable which you declare in a class is called as class level variable.
Any variable which you declare in a method is called as method level variable.

---------------------------------
Calculator c= new Calculator();
c is object or reference.
When constructors are called?
constructors are called automatically after creating an object.

>in programming languages,space is a character.
And each symbol is a character.
We cannot have 2 constructor with same parameters.

Overloading: Overloading means a function or a constructor with same name and difffrent parameters.
>functions and constructors can be overloaded.But classes cannot.

Write a java program to multiply 2 numbers and convert text to lowercase using constructor overloading.
Note: Always unnamed blocks will be executed first and then constructor will be executed.

Static: static is high priority.It is like VIP.

Any thing which is declared as static will be loaded first into memory.

Non static:non static means objects.------low priority
Non static will be loaded at last.

static int a =90;--first
int w=89;--last

static contenst doent know anything about non static.
Non static contents knows static.

from a static block,we cannot call object.Unnamed blocks will be executed when we create an object.

static blocks---------unnamed blocks------constructors------functions
L---------->Right

>>>>>Rule: try to avoid static and unamed blocks in projects,because it creates confusion to developers.
-------------------------------

Inheritance: Process of getting the properties of base class to child class is called as inheritance.
>to work on inheritance,we need to have atleast 2 classes.
>to acheive inheritance we will use the keyword "extends".
> by default all claases inherits the properties fom Object class.
Object is the basee class in JAva.

Father--base--parent
|
srinivas--childclass
Note: private variable are methods cannot be inherited.
Access specifieers: private,public and protected.
child class can access base class methods.

>>>Overriding: Overriding means a function with same name,same parameter but in diffrent classes.

Note: super is a keyword,which points to base class.

To call parent class method from child class,then we need to use "Super" keyword.
Syntax: super.methodname();

Static methodss should be called using classname.
syntax:

classname.methodname();
>>A constructor cannot be static.
>>Overloading or overiding  feature is not applicable for static.

Day3(june 12th):
==================
>interfaces and abstract  classes,inheritance exercises and example
collections
jdbc--introduction and one program
JPA---introduction

Concrete class:
A class with concrete methods is called as concrete class.
>We can create an object for concrete class.

Abstract class/partially abstract class:
A class with concrete  methods or atleast one abstract method is called as abstract class.
>We cannot create an object for Abstract class.

Fully abstract class:
A class with fully abstract methods is called as fully abstract class.
>>We cannot create an object for fully Abstract class.
>a method is declareed as abstract,by using abstract keyword.


If we dont the requirement clearly,then better to go with abstract classes.
If we are clear about requirement clearly,then better to go with concrete classes.

>>A class can be asbtract ny delcaring abstract infront of class.Even though class is abstract,we need to declare the required methods as abstract.

Abstract method: method without logic or body is called as Abstract method.
concrete method: method with logic or body is called as concrete method.

<Jdk1.8
Interface:An interface is similar like a class but with only abstract methods.

Syntax: interface <interfacename>
{

// abstract methods.
}

When to use interface and when to use class.
class: If we understand all requirements and clear about the implementation,then only go with class.
Interface: Assume,customer requirements are changing frequently,and we are not clear about the logic,then use interfaces.

Always coding designing should start with interfaces.

1)interfaces---->abstract classes---->concrete classes

or 

2)interfaces---->concrete classes

on 12th customer gave requirement
on 13th customer modified requirement
?
abstract
>if we want to write implementation for interface methods then you class should implement interface.
implements is a keyword.

>>We cannot create an object for interface.We can create obj for the implementation class.
>>An interface can extend another interface.
Rules:
In projects,we shld not write/delcare interface and implementation class in same file.---->not recommended
Interfaces shld be in different package and implementation classes shld be in different package---->recommended.

For every interface comments and documentation shld be done.

From jdk1.8 onwards,we can also have concrete method in interface.We can also have static and default methods in interface from jdk1.8 onwards.

>An interface can have constants.By default all constants are static in interface.
>>>>How do we can achieve abstraction in java? ans)interfaces.
===========================================
Collections-20%
------------
>Array: an array is a group of silimar datatypes.
int a[]={22,33,"sss"};---wrong
Assume were you wan to store diffrent types of values?
sol)collections.
>>Interfaces in collections:
collection,set,map,queue,List......etc

>>collection is an interface.It is part of util package.
>>All methods in collection interface are abstract.
>In collection,we are going to store only objects,no primitive types.

Example:
int a =90; //primitive datatype
Integer a =90;
or Integer a= new Integer(90);//Object
char--Character
int---Integer
float----Float
long-----Long

>>parseInt will convert string to integer.
isDigit is used for checking whether the stored value is number or not.If number it will be true.
isDigit will not do type casting.It will check whether it is no or character.

>>In java,for evry class Object is a Base class.
>>Evry object will have hashcode.
>eevry object can be cloned ie duplicated.
>>Any no of objects can be pushed to collection.No limit.
clone() means copy
>>HAshset:
===========
>>HAshset doent allow duplicates.
it will never through error msg in case of duplicates.Simply it will ignore.
>>Hashset allows null values.
>>Hashset doent maintain insertion order of elements.
>hashset works on hashing algorityhm.
To display elements in collections we can use below ways:
1)using for each or any loop
2)Iterator

hasNext will check whether collectin has values or not.If values are available it will be true
otherwise false.
next() method will mpove your courser and then it will display the value.
>While dealing with null,please surround your code with try and catch.


Exercise1:
add 1 to 10 numbers into Hashset using loops and display the values in hashset using iterator.

if we want to insert specific type of values ,then we need to use generics.
Syntax:<datatype>
Example:<Integer>

Exercise 2:
add 1 to 10 numbers into Hashset using loops and display the values in hashset in reverse order.

>>Treeset---completed
>HashMap
>Hashset(completed)
>TreeMap
>Vector
>ArrayList
=============
Treeset:
------------
>will not allow duplicates.
>elements will be displayed in ascending order.
>When we try to insert null values and then ruun the program,it will throw NULLPOINTER Eception.
>In treeset,always insert similar datatypes,otherwise it will throw classcast exception.
Treeset is faster than hashset in terms of performance and searching.

>Amazon uses collection concept internally for ADDing to  Cart feature.it uses HAshmap.

ArrayList:
----------
>Once array size is given,it is fixed.We cannot insert more than the array size.
>Arraylist is like array but its size is dynamic.it can grow and it can shrink.
int a[]= new int[3];
>Arraylist allows duplicates.
>Arraylist is slow when it comes to perfomance on manipulations.
>Arraylist maintains insertion order.
>>Arraylist is not syncronized ie not thread safe.Data will be corrupted if all are trying to access.


Assume there is suitation where we need to convert arraylist to array.Now what is the process to do that?
Ans)toArray()

toArray() is used for convert arraylist to array.

Question 1)Assume there is a Arraylist with multiple duplicate values.Design a program which should remove duplicates from collection.

Vector:
=======
>>Vector is very old class which was relased with jdk1.2.
>>Vector is similar like arraylist but it is thread safe.
>>will allow duplicates.
>>Order is maintained.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html

HashMap:*******************
=======
>>Hashmap is not syncronized.
>In hashmap,we are going to insert data in the form of keys and values.
>Allows null elements but we shld have only 1 null key.
>>All keys are unique.
>>maintains no order.

key will be product code
value will be price of the product

Hashtable:
==========
>>hashtable is syncronized and it is old class
>>hashtable contains unique elements.
>doent allow null key or null values.


Treemap
=======
>>contains keys and values.
>contains unique elements
>>cannot jave null key but can have multiple null values.
>>order is maintained

Any collection with  name Tree maintain order ie ascending order.

JPA
-----
Prerequisite: JDbc

JDBC: jdbc stands for java database connectivity.

C--create
R---read
U----update
D--delete
>jdbc is used for connecting and performing crud operations on databases from JAva.
>before jdbc ,we are having ODBC.ODBC stands for open databse connectivity.odbc is not platform independent.thats why odbc is a failure.ODBC is writtened in C++.
>>jdbc apis are written in java.So it is platform independent.
>currently 4.3 is version of jdbc.

Drawbacks:
1)slow
2)drivers are needed based on database.
3)High end network shld be there.

ODBC----->JDBC----->JPA

>>Driver: is a software program which will connect java app to any type of database.
device drivers

Using jdbc ,if we want to conenct to db,we are having 4 types of drivers.
1)JDBC-odbc bridge driver/Type1(failure)
2)Native driver/Type2 driver(failure)
3)net work protocl/Type3 driver driver(failure)
4)Thin driver/Type4 driver---in market is famous

TO design any program using jdbc follow below steps.
1)Connect to database using db credentials,ipaddress and port no.
2)once connect is established,write sql query to extract.
3)once results are fetched from database,display it.
4)close the connection
Day4(JPA) 13th June:
========================
Mysql: localhost
Default port of mysql: 3306
Default username: root

Below is the command to view list of databases in mysql:
show databases;
>>
sudo apt install mysql-server
mysql --version
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql -u root

>>>>To work on jdbc,we need some dependencies ie jar files.TO deals with jars and to run and build the app,we are going to use MAVEN tool.
IN maven,
groupid means package name
artifactid means projectname.

>>MAven is a build tool.If we want to build any java project,we can do that using maven.
Maven is used mainly in microservices,cloud and fullstack developments.
>>>>Advantages of Maven:
>Using maven we can build the project.
>Maven can download dependencies automatically.
>it can handle transitive dependencies in proper way.
>Dependency management is simplified using maven.
>Maven can build the project using different profiles.
......etc

When we want to work on third party tools,then we need to download third party jar files.Without those jar file,we can write the code.

Example: I want to create a pdf file using java.

Using java can we crreate pdf file directly? no.then we need to use third party tools/vendor jars.
jar---3.0

Steps for adding vendor jars  manual Approach:
----------------------------------------------
1)Identify the vendor library.
2)download the specific version of library
3)Add the jar file to build path>configure build path>Add External Jars
4)and then click ok.


Assume you are working in banking project for which you are using 2100 jars.then how much time will it take to add?
ans)time consuming task4.0

After 3 days customer asked to change the jar version?

>When we migrate the project from one server to another server,dependencies might fail because of path issues.To handle such type of suitations,we use Maven.

In maveen,we are having a configuration file withthe name pom.xml.
In pom.xml we are going to going to write info about your jar file.

>Maven is having its own public repository for jars.
https://mvnrepository.com/

To connect a java app to database,we need to follow below steps:
1)Load Jdbc driver class(type4 driver).==>Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
class.forname will load "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"  driver into memory
2)Establish connection to database
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/training","root","mysql");
3)create a statement
Statement st = con.createStatement();
4)Execute Sql queries on db
st.executeQuery("select * from employee");
5)Process the resultset
Whatever output we are getting after running executeQuery shld be stored ina collection called as "resultSet"
ResultSet rs= st.executeQuery("select * from employee");
while(rs.next())
{
}

6)close the connection with db

rs.close();//close resultset
st.close();//staetement shld be closed
con.close();//connection shld be closed

In java varchar means string.
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD_HERE'

jdbc app is unable to connect to mysql because the jdbc app is not a super user.

Mysql will check whether you are super user or normal user.
super user--means super admin
normal user----developer

Super user permissions are diffrent and normal user permissions are diffrent.

jdbc----------->driver-------------->mysql

>>James --salary shld be changed to 9300
Existing: 3334 id is 1

>>In jdbc we are having 3 types of Statements to run your sql queries.
1)Statement: is prone to attack
2)PreparedStatement: 
>use this statement to push runtime inputs to your query.
>Prepared statements can avoid SQL injections.
>readability is good
3)CallableStatement:
>CallableStatement is used for calling db stored procedures and functions.
? means it is a placholder.

>>In  databases,we are BLOB,CLOB and NCLOB datatypes.
BLOB=>binary large object.When we want to store images/audio/video files.Example: limit is 2gb
CLOB=>character large object->i want to store resume/pdf/docs.Example: limit is 1gb
NCLOB==> 'n ' no of character large objects

blob,clob,nclob are called as large objects.
>>In realtime,very rarely we use above.instead we will use Hadoop or cloud.
Youtube using apache Kafka tool and Hadoop for live videos and live streaming.
>Hadoop uses internally large objects.

if you had worked on PL/sql components,then callable statements are helpful.

Req: write a java program which should read data from excel sheet and then it shld insert the data in sheeet to database.

====================================================================================================================
JPA
====
>jpa stands for java persistance API.this is used for performing CRUD operations.
>JPA is not a technology or tool.It is a specification.
>Specification means rules and regulations to design code for backend.

select * from tab;---this works in oracle.in mysql it wont work.

SQL Queries are not same for all databases.differebt dbs will have diffrent syntaxes.

hadour ----13th june Example1:	
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
			con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/training", "root", "mysql");
			//String sql = "update employee set salary = 9300 where id=1";
			String sql = "update employee set salary = ? where id= ?";
			st = con.prepareStatement(sql);
			System.out.println("Enter Salary:");
			st.setInt(1,s.nextInt());
			System.out.println("Enter record-id:");
			st.setInt(2,s.nextInt());
			st.execute();
>>
Class.forName("com.oracle.jdbc.Driver");//changes
			con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:xe://localhost:/training", "root", "mysql");//changes
			//String sql = "update employee set salary = 9300 where id=1";
			String sql = "update employee set salary = ? where id= ?";
			st = con.prepareStatement(sql);
			System.out.println("Enter Salary:");
			st.setInt(1,s.nextInt());
			System.out.println("Enter record-id:");
			st.setInt(2,s.nextInt());
			st.execute();	
>>if we use jdbc we need to change the code,when database changes,but if we use JPA no need to change code.only change db details.

>>we had written code for oracle.---schema is runnig in server1 192.34.3.12

lets migrate the code to new server ,server2 198.21.33.55

challenges:
1)db schema shld be moved
2)data dump shld be taken and then moved to target db.

>JPA can create schema automatically.Auto schema generation
>ORM--object relation mapping.

convert class to table  and table to class.
 
 credentials:
 username password
 
 
 class Credentials
 {
 private String username;
 private String password;
 }

Using JPA Api's,we are going to persist and retrive data from dbs.

Who is implementing JPA?
ans)Hibernate,toplink,ibatis....etc

Hibernate is implementaion of JPA.

In hibernate,b we need to create a pojo class for the same table.

Assume there is a table with name Address and column "fullname",streetno and pincode


POJO: pojo stands for plain old java objects.

Rules: A class can be pojo,if it follows below rules.
1)Shld not implement any interface
2)variables shld be private
3)Methods shld be public
4)pojo classes hld not extend other classes expect Object class.
5)We shld not use static methods or static.
6)for every varaible we shld have setters and getter methods.
7)Always make sure pojo classes are created sepretly in a new package.It shld not be in default package.
setter method will start with set.
getter method will start with get

To design any program in Hibernate,we need to have below files:
1)Pojo classes
2)Helper classes(if required)
3)hibernate.cfg.xml file---src/main/resources
4)Test class
5)DAO class

Note:  all above files shld be placed in separate packages.if we place all files in same package then code wont work.

hibernate.cfg.xml:
=================
cfg stands for configuration.
>in hibernate.cfg ,we are going to add database metadata.
db meta data means db ipaddress,port no,username,password,schemaname...etc

DAO:
======
>DAO stands for data access object.
>dao itself is a design pattern for databases
>in DAO we are going to write the required logic to access db.
>DaI stands for data access interfaces.we need tto create new package for dai.
POJO+DAO+DAI


Above is the project structure for Hibernate.

for reading the data from excel sheet use APAche POI library.
