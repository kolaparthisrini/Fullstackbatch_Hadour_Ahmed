Basics of Java:
-----------------
Java is a programming language.
Any hardware is controlled through s/w.

>>>>>>>>Thses s/w are designed using C,C++,.net or java.
>Java is more popular because of platform independency.
Java comes with 3 editions.
1)JSE/J2SE: JSE stands for Java Standard Edition.JSE is used for creating desktop apps like ms-office,notepad....
2)JEE/J2EE: JEE stands for JAva enterprise edition.JEE is used for creating Enterprise apps like banking,insurance...
3)JME/J2ME:Java Mobile edition.USed for designing mobile apps or can be used for Embedded Systems.
Embedded systems is a combination of hardware and s/w.
>>JME is a failure for designing mobile apps.

Latest version of java is 1.19.Industry is using still 1.8.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Features of JAva:
1)Java is secure
2)robust
3)Platform independent....etc


If s/w is designed using "C/C+:,then that code will not work in All o/s.

If a Programming language supports pointers,then that programming language will not run in all o/s.
>>In programming languages,every variable will have an address.That address we are calling it as Pointers.
Java doesnt support pointers.Thats why it is platform independent.
Java code be executed in any type of operating system,because it is platform independent.

>>>C:\Program Files\Java

TO design any program using java,we need to follow the below way.

Write the code-------->Save the code(save the file with .java)------>Compile the code using java Compiler------>Run the code(.class)

To compile or to run a java code,we need to have JDK  and JVM.In eclipse,Auto compilation feature is enabled by default.
If we use IDE,no need to compile.


Projectname/classname firstletter shouldbe Upper Case.
We should not use Spaces in file or projectname.
Always Substring should start with upper case.
Example:
Helloworld---not accepted
HelloWorld----Accepted
Dont use unnecessarily special symbols like &~@$%^*().
Always code shld be created in a package.We should avoid default packages.
Package should follow below syntax:
Example: com.projectname.modulename

Package names shld not be in upper case.
>>We can create as many packages as we can.There is no limit on no of packages.

Example:

Assume you are working on 4 requirements.
4 difrrent packages shld be created.

Assume projectname is Maheshbank.
com.maheshbank.fundtrasfer
com.maheshbank.payments
Note: Default is not allowed in projects.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

Library : library is a type of package with predefined methods,classes with logic.
libraries are of 2 types.
1)predefined :oracle is giving to us by default.
2)Userdefined--means developer will create.

Steps for running code:
1)Write the code in a file and save the file using .java.
2)Compile the code using javac command.
3)After compiling,we will get .class file which is bytecode.
4)After that run the .class file using java command.

Bytecode: bytecode is a combination of o,1 and special symbols.

Note: Always public classname and filename should be same.

JVM stands for java virtual machine.JVM is used for running the code.

Command to compile: javac filename.java
Running: java filename


Points: installed Eclipse,set the jdk path,testing java program,features of java,compiling the code,running the code on IDE and command prompt,bytecode,package creation,naming rules for project creation,type s of java editions.

Comments:

single line comment:Syntax://
Multi line comments:
Syntax:
/*
text1
text2

*/
Note: Dont use predefined keywords in comments.
Always make sure your comments are meanining full.dont use your language which is diffrent while writing.
Make sure you are adding author of the code.

>Makesure you are formating your code before commenting.
Jira is a issue tracking tool which is mainly used in development.

Variables and datatypes
loops 
String API
condtional staments
command line arguments---important while deployments

OOPS,collections,multithreading basics
Variables and datatypes:
========================
>variable:
============
a variable is a container/storage for storing your data temporarly.
>Evry variable will have a datatype.
>a variable cannot exist without datatype.
>variable shld be named properly and it should be meaningfull.

Syntax for declaring a variable:

Datatype variablename;

Syntax for defining or storing value in a variable:

Datatype <variablename> = <value>

Example: int a = 90;

Datatype specifies the type of data that we want to store in a variable.

bit means either 1 or 0
1 byte = 8 bits
bytes= no of bits/8

Primitive datatypes:
---------------------------
boolean-------1 bit---default value is false
char----------2 bytes---default value is \u0000
byte-------1 byte---default value is 0
short---2 bytes---default value is 0
int-----4 bytes---default value is 0
long------8 bytes---default value is 0L
float----4 bytes---default value is 0.0f
double-------8 bytes---default value is 0.0


boolean a = true;
System.out.println(a);


Non primitive datatypes:
-----------------------
class,interfaces,String and arrays


>System.out.println()
System is predefined class.
out is a static reference
println is a predefined method.

out means output ie monitor
in means input ie keyboard
error means error

i want to give a value and b vaule at runtime?

>>Scanner class is mainly for inserting values at runtime.

Once scanner is opened,we need to close it.

Note: As per best practices,we need to close the scanner object.

In java,if we want to make a variable a constant,then we need to use the keyword "final".

final int con;//declared
con = 90;//defined
		
final int con = 90;//delcared and defined

--------------------------------
String API

String is a group of characters.
>Strings are represented using "".
>>Character are represented using ''.

I/p: apple
o/p: APPLE

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

String had given us so many predefined methods to deal with conversions.

1)
String t = "Skolaparthi";
i/p: a
o/p: available

i/p: z
o/p: Not available

Loops and conditional Statements:
---------------------------------
>
Conditional Statements:
---------------------------
when even we want to perform conditional checkings.
1)if
if condition will check for true or false.
2)if-else
3)switch

i need to check whether the given value is > 100 or not.
Note: At a time only one block will be executed in if-else.

if()
{
if()
{
}
}


Switch is mainly for checking/testing multiple conditions.
Switch is replacement for nested-ifs.
Syntax:

switch(expression)
{
case value:
//statements
break;

case value:
//statements
break;

case value:
//statements
break;

default:
//statements
}

using switch:

i/p is Apple
o/p:Apple is matched

Switch Rules:
=============
>switch accepts integeres,strings and enums from >1.7.0 version onwards.
enums are like classes but it is used for creating multiple constants.
>any no of switch cases can be written.
>only one default is allowed.
>break statement is optional in switch,but removing break might cause your logic change.
>Every case shld have only 1 break.
>break shld be last statement in case.
>No break is allowed in default.
>break is not recommended in default case.It will never throw any error message.

Note: switch within switch is accepted.

Loops:
======
Loops are used for repeating as task until condition fails.
1)for---to
2)while

in while first condition is checked and then body is executed.
Syntax:

while(condition)
{

increment/decrement values;
}
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


3)do-while

reverse of while is do while.
start;
do
{
} while(condition);

first body is executed and then condition is checked.

display 2 5 8 11


I want to display 2 table.

2*1=2
2*2=4
2*3=6
2*10=20

+ operator is used for string concatenation.
4)for-each















































































































































>To write a logic,we neeed to have atleast 1 class.
>class will have functions.
>A class can have as many functions.There is not limit.
>A class which is declared as public should have main method.
>Main is the starting point of the program.


package com.training.basics;

public class Addition {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
===================
public class Addition {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}--------------------------------->invalid

 class Addition {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}------------------------------------>invalid,because no public infornt of class.

===========================
public class Addition {

	

}------>not valid.because if a class is declared as public ,then main method is mandetory.

>>In a java file,we cannot have 2 classes with public mode.
